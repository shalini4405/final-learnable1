        <p>Responsive design ensures that web applications look and function well on a variety of devices and window sizes.</p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Core Principles</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Using relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Images that scale within their containing elements</li>
          <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS rules that apply different styles based on device characteristics</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Mobile-First Approach</h3>
        <p>Starting design from the smallest screen and working up to larger ones offers several advantages:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <li>Forces prioritization of content</li>
          <li>Ensures essential functionality works on all devices</li>
          <li>Generally leads to cleaner, more efficient code</li>
          <li>Aligns with the growing trend of mobile usage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Common Breakpoints</h3>
        <p>While breakpoints should be determined by content, common ranges include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Small:</strong> Up to 640px (mobile phones)</li>
          <li><strong>Medium:</strong> 641px to 1024px (tablets and small laptops)</li>
          <li><strong>Large:</strong> 1025px and above (desktops and large screens)</li>
